# Module-9-Challenge-SurfsUp
## 1. Project Overview
### Background:
W. Avy would like some assistance in reviewing temperature trends before opening up a surf shop, specifically the temperature data in Oahu, Hawaii to see if her idea of a surf and ice cream shop would be viable year-round. I.E. are the temperature ranges in the peak of summer and winter in the ideal range for a Surfing and Ice Cream bussiness to thrive.
### Purpose:
The Code is intended to filter the date of June and the temperature readings of June from a SQLite file into a list and convert said list into a dataframe. Then to retrieve the summary statistics from the dataframe for the temerature measurements. Rinse and repeat for the month of December. Lastly, to convert said summary statistics into insight for W. Avy.
